Sure thing, Tim! Here's a design document and a step-by-step plan to create a Snake game.

### Design Document: Snake Game

**Game Title:** Classic Snake

**Overview:**
Classic Snake is a simple yet engaging game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body while collecting as much food as possible to achieve a high score.

**Gameplay:**

- The player controls the snake using arrow keys (or WASD keys).
- The snake moves continuously in the direction of the player's input.
- The game area is a grid where the snake and food appear.
- Food randomly spawns on the grid, and the snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
- The player's score increases with each piece of food eaten.

**Game Mechanics:**

1. **Snake Movement:**
   - Continuous movement in the direction of the player's input.
   - Change direction based on input (up, down, left, right).

2. **Food Spawn:**
   - Randomly place food on the grid.
   - Ensure food does not spawn on the snake's body.

3. **Collision Detection:**
   - Detect collision with walls.
   - Detect collision with the snake's own body.

4. **Score:**
   - Increment score by 1 for each piece of food eaten.
   - Display current score on the screen.

5. **Game Over:**
   - Triggered by collision with walls or snake's body.
   - Display game over message and final score.

**Art and Sound:**

- Simple graphics: colored rectangles for the snake and food.
- Optional: Add simple sound effects for eating food and game over.

**Controls:**

- Arrow keys (or WASD) for movement.

**Development Steps:**

1. **Set Up the Project:**
   - Create a new project in your game engine.
   - Set up the game window and grid layout.

2. **Implement Snake Movement:**
   - Create the snake as a series of connected segments.
   - Implement continuous movement and change direction based on player input.

3. **Spawn Food:**
   - Randomly place food on the grid.
   - Ensure food does not spawn on the snake.

4. **Grow the Snake:**
   - Add a new segment to the snake each time it eats food.
   - Increase the score by 1.

5. **Collision Detection:**
   - Detect and handle collisions with walls.
   - Detect and handle collisions with the snake's body.

6. **Game Over Logic:**
   - Implement game over conditions.
   - Display game over message and final score.

7. **Display Score:**
   - Show the current score on the screen.

8. **Polish:**
   - Add basic graphics and optional sound effects.
   - Test and debug the game.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Set Up the Project:**
   - Initialize a new project.
   - Create the game window with a grid layout (e.g., 20x20 cells).

2. **Implement Snake Movement:**
   - Create a `Snake` class with attributes for position and direction.
   - Implement continuous movement in the current direction.
   - Add methods to change direction based on player input.

3. **Spawn Food:**
   - Create a `Food` class with a random position generator.
   - Ensure food does not spawn on the snake.

4. **Grow the Snake:**
   - Add a method in the `Snake` class to grow the snake by adding a new segment.
   - Increase the score when the snake eats food.

5. **Collision Detection:**
   - Implement methods to detect collisions with walls.
   - Implement methods to detect collisions with the snake's body.

6. **Game Over Logic:**
   - Add a game over condition when a collision is detected.
   - Display a game over message and the final score.

7. **Display Score:**
   - Create a simple UI to display the current score.

8. **Polish:**
   - Add simple graphics for the snake and food.
   - Add sound effects for eating food and game over (optional).
   - Test the game thoroughly to ensure it runs smoothly and debug any issues.

By following these steps, you should have a classic Snake game up and running, providing a great way to familiarize yourself with your game engine. Let me know if you need any specific code examples or further details on any part of the process!
